      <h1 id="home">Physics-Based Simulation &amp; Animation of Fluids</h1>
      <p>Do you ever wonder how special effects using fluids like water are animated for movies? In this tutorial, we'll show you how to simulate fluids using the popular Fluid-Implicit-Particle / Particle-in-Cell (FLIP/PIC) method.</p>
      <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
      <p>This tutorial is designed with a second- or third-year college student in mind. A bit of experience with programming in an Ubuntu Linux environment, with some exposure to physics and differential, integral, and multivariable (vector) calculus are assumed, but not strictly required. We assume you have some way to run your code in the Ubuntu Linux operating system, but it's very possible to alter some commands slightly to run everything on a Windows PC or Mac.</p>
