      <h1 id="home">Physics-Based Simulation &amp; Animation of Fluids</h1>
      <p>Do you ever wonder how special effects using fluids like water are animated for movies? In this tutorial, we'll show you how to simulate fluids using the popular Fluid-Implicit-Particle / Particle-in-Cell (FLIP/PIC) method.</p>
      <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
      <p>This tutorial is designed assuming a year or two of experience or exposure to:
      <ul>
        <li>Computer programming in C++</li>
        <li>Using a terminal on a computer running Linux, e.g., the Ubuntu operating system</li>
        <li>Newtonian mechanics, e.g., <i>F</i> = <i>ma</i>, momentum, position, velocity, acceleration</li>
        <li>Calculus: differential, integral, and vector calculus</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Some exposure to computer graphics helps but is certainly not required. If you're a second- or third-year computer science college student, you have more than enough background! This If you don't feel like an expert in any of these things, that's okay! You can probably skip a lot of the math and physics if you're just trying to get some code running. There is no shame in looking up things!</p>
